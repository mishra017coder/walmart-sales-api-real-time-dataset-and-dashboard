# Walmart Sales API Project

This project is built using **FastAPI** to expose Walmart sales data through RESTful APIs.

## üìÇ Features

- `GET /` ‚Üí Welcome message (status check)
- `GET /sales` ‚Üí Returns full cleaned sales data
- `GET /high_sales` ‚Üí Returns records where Weekly_Sales > 50,000

## üìä Sample Dataset

Due to GitHub‚Äôs file size limit (100 MB), the full dataset `Walmart.csv` is not uploaded.  
Instead, a smaller file `sample_walmart.csv` with limited rows is provided for testing.

If needed, full data can be shared via external link (e.g., Google Drive or email).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This API

Make sure you have Python and FastAPI installed.

### 1. Install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the app using Uvicorn
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### 3. Test the API in browser or Postman
